somebody once told me
the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
she was looking kinda dumb
with her finger and her thumb
in the shape of an L
on her forehead

Well, the years start comin
and they dont stop comin
feck to the rules cause we hit the town running
so much to do so much to see
so whats wrong with taking the back street
you'll never know if you don't go
you'll never shine if you don't glow
